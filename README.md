Polyratings Data
-----
The following repository contains a daily dump of the **entire** [Polyratings.com](https://polyratings.dev) site. 

You can find the generated files in the [data branch](https://github.com/Polyratings/polyratings-data/tree/data).

Uses for this data include:
- Backups/restore points for the actual site
- Student Projects
- Interesting dataset to analyze

If you're interested in working more closely with the developers of the site, or are interested in actually working on Polyratings itself,
